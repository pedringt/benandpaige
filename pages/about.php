		<h2>location & information</h2>
		<p>A small ceremony will take place somewhere in Bloomington, most likely around 4:30pm. I'll post an update once we figure out what the hell we're doing.</p><br >
		<p>A dinner will follow the ceremony at Scholar's Inn Restaurant in B-town.</p>
		<p>717 N College Ave</p><br >
		<p>Scholar's Inn will open to us around 5:30pm. The dinner will probably last until about 9 or so, and then we plan on hitting the town and turning it up and generally partying until I inevitably ruin my dress.</p>
		<p>The dinner will be a fairly small gathering, so you'll want to get a sitter for the childrens. Sorry kids, I'll go get drunk with you for your 21st birthday and do something embarrassing to make it up to you.</p>
		<br>
		<p>I have reserved a block of rooms at a couple of fine local hotels. Just mention Edrington-Dunn wedding when making your reservation.<br >

		There are also plenty of other hotels if you want to keep it cheap. I don't recommend the Days Inn next to Denny's, though. (Unless you're looking for an adventure in Pube Forest).
